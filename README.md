#  Contact Page – DMV Tech Services

##  What I Built
I built a responsive Contact Page for DMV Tech Services as part of a web development / internship assessment task.

The page includes:
- Company contact details displayed vertically
- A “Send Me a Message” contact form
- Email sending functionality using Formspree
- An embedded Google Map showing the office location
- A footer with complete company information

The layout follows the **exact wireframe provided in the PDF** and is designed to work smoothly on all desktop screen sizes.

##  Tools and Technologies Used
- HTML5 – For structuring the webpage  
- CSS3 – For styling and layout customization  
- Bootstrap 5 – For responsive design and grid layout  
- JavaScript – For form validation and user feedback  
- Formspree – To send form submissions as emails (no backend required)  
- Font Awesome – For icons  
- Google Maps Embed – To show the company’s location  

##  Features
- Vertical contact details section:
  - Address
  - Phone number
  - Email
  - Website
- Contact form with:
  - Required field validation
  - Email format validation
  - Success and failure messages after submission
- Emails sent directly to the site owner using Formspree
- Embedded Google Map with accurate coordinates
- Clean footer with company details
- Fully responsive layout using Bootstrap

##  Challenges Faced
- Integrating Formspree and understanding form endpoints
- Implementing proper validation with Bootstrap styling
- Matching the layout exactly as per the given wireframe
- Ensuring responsiveness without using card-based layouts

##  What I Learned
- How to integrate Formspree in a frontend-only project
- Handling form validation using HTML5 and JavaScript
- Building responsive layouts using Bootstrap
- Embedding Google Maps using coordinates
- Writing a professional `README.md` for GitHub projects

##  How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Open the project folder in VS Code
3. Open index.html using Live Server
4. Ensure the Formspree action URL is correctly added in the form
5. Fill out the form and submit to test email functionality
